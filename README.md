# Semantic Textual Similarity (STS):

## Dataset:

* Semantic Textual Similarity 2012-2017 Dataset
* The benchmark comprises 8628 sentence pairs. Each sentence pair is accompained with a similarity score (0-5), where 0 being least similar and 5 being most similar. 
* The train-dev-test splits is as follows:

||train|dev|test|total|
|:-------|:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------|

|forum|450|375|254|1079|
|total|5749|1500|1379|8628|

## Methodology:

* I have design a system similar to the one proposed in "Siamese Recurrent Architectures for Learning Sentence Similarity".
* Instead of a plain LSTM. I have used a BiLSTM followed by a dense layer.
* The loss used to exponential of the negative Manhattan distance between 2 sentence representations generated by the Siamese Network.
* The results can be further improved using the non-parametric log-linear classifier in the post-processing step as illustrated in the base paper.

## Files:

* utils.py file contains all the helper funcitons.
* siamese_model.py contains the model architecture.
* main.ipynb contains the implementation.
